## Hardware Setup

The laser file for the case iy in the `00_case` folder. It is intended for 3mm thick acrylic glass.

### Components

* Raspberry Pi
* [Thermal Printer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/597)
* [LED Matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1080)

## Installation

### Prepare The Raspberry Pi

Download a [Rapsbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) image and write it onto an SD card.

After the setup, allow SSH connections, to interface with it on your Computer. Therefore load the [`00_pi-setup/ssh`](00_pi-setup/ssh) onto the installation SD card's root.

After that load the [`00_pi-setup/wpa_supplicant.conf`](00_pi-setup/wpa_supplicant.conf), update it with your WiFi credentials and upload it to the SD card root as well.

Now install Raspbian onto the Raspberry Pi.

Once installed you should be able to access it on your computer terminal. To find it from your computer, install *arp-scan*, I recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install arp-scan
```

Then run `sudo arp-scan --localnet`  and search for 'Raspberry'.

Once your have found the correct IP address, you should be able to log into its terminal using `ssh pi@<IP-address>`, the default password is `raspberry`

Enable GPIO and I2C to enable the hardware components to communicate with the Raspberry. To do so, open the configuration of the Raspberry by entering:

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

Enable pigpiod by making it executable ([source](https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/tree/master/util)):

```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/pigpiod
```

Keep in mind to update you locale according to your location:

```sh
export LANGUAGE=en_GB.UTF-8
export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8
locale-gen en_GB.UTF-8
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Now we need to disable the power-safe mode, so that the printer keeps printing. Therefore we need to open and edit this file.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Then add or update the following lines to the document and save it:

```sh
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
post-up iw wlan0 set power_save off
```

Add to this file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```

The following lines:

```sh
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
point-rpi

# Run shell script to boot node js server
@sleep 5s # give time to start node server

# @sh /home/pi/Desktop/littleBigPrinter/boot.sh 
# this script automatically starts the node script within a terminal window
@lxterminal -e "/home/pi/Desktop/littleBigPrinter/boot.sh"

xset s off #
xset -dpms 
```

Finally update node-red, install [node js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). This should to the trick:

```sh
sudo apt update
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash

curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

### Upload LittleBigPrinter Program

For easier upload of the repository files, connect via FTP to upload your code. The credentials for that are as follows:

```
Host = <IP-address>
Username = pi
Password = raspberry
Port = 22
```

Upload this folder to the Desktop and open it in your terminal window `cd Desktop/littleBigPrinter`.
Once in the folder hit `yarn install` to install all relevant dependencies.

To let the printer automatically start the script on boot, edit the *.bashrc* file, by hitting `sudo nano .bashrc` and add the following:

```sh
# Run node js server
echo "Starting NodeJS Server"
cd /home/pi/Desktop/littleBigPrinter
sudo yarn start
```

Now the printer should automatically start on reboot.
